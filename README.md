# Heuristic project
This repository provides two notebooks for working with articles based on Warcraft data: [Differentiation of Blackbox Combinatorial Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02175) and [Path Planning using Neural A* Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07476)

Notebooks use forks of the original repositories with some changes: [BB_Planners.ipynb](https://github.com/Petilia/blackbox-differentiation-combinatorial-solvers) and [NeuralAstar.ipynb](https://github.com/vd-kuznetsov/neural-astar)
